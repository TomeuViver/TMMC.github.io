# Taxonomy and Metagenomics of Microbial Communities

## Lecturers

- **Ramon Rossello-Mora**  
  *Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies [(IMEDEA-CSIC-UIB)](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/), Spain*
- **Tomeu Viver**  
  *Max-Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology [(MPI, Germany)](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/Max-Planck-Institut-fuer-Marine-Mikrobiologie-in-Bremen.html), and [IMEDEA-CSIC-UIB](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/)*

## Description

In this workshop, students will explore key concepts in microbial taxonomy and ecology, gaining hands-on experience in prokaryotic systematics. The course will cover the analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes obtained from both whole genomes and shotgun amplicon sequencing approaches. Additionally, participants will learn how to process genome-resolved metagenomes, guiding them through the entire workflow from raw sequencing data to the taxonomic classification of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will:

- Understand **microbial species concepts and definitions**, particularly in the context of genome-resolved metagenomics for analyzing prokaryotic community diversity.
- Gain practical experience in applying **computational approaches to analyze 16S ribosomal RNA genes and metagenomic data**, with a focus on genome-resolved MAGs for characterizing prokaryotic diversity and metabolic potential.
- Assess the **quality of both raw metagenomic data and MAGs** to ensure reliable downstream analyses.
- Utilize cutting-edge genome similarity methods to identify **taxonomic novelty in MAGs** and **propose new taxa**.
- Integrate the latest guidelines from the **Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data (SeqCode)** to formally describe newly identified prokaryotic taxa.
